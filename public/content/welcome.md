# Welcome to CYPHER OS

Hey there, I'm **Alex**, and welcome to **CYPHER OS**.

CYPHER OS is a interactive desktop that showcases my projects, background, and documentation — all inside a desktop-like environment you can actually use.

You can start here: See what I’ve built at [My Projects](/my-projects), learn about me at [Who Am I](/whoami) or check out how the site works in the [Documentation](/documentation)

---

Everything behaves like a real desktop — you can:

- Drag and arrange windows
- Open and close apps
- Minimize, maximize, and restore
- Navigate through folders

Enjoy exploring — everything here is interactive, so open folders and files and have a poke around!
