# About This Website

This site exists to showcase my work in a format that's actually memorable.

Instead of another scrolling portfolio with project cards, I built a desktop operating system where you navigate through folders, open documents, and interact with windows. It's more interesting than explaining what I do - it demonstrates it.

## The Concept

**Standard portfolio problem:** After reviewing 50 developer portfolios, they all look the same. Hero section, skills grid, project cards, contact form. Professional, clean, forgettable.

**My solution:** Build something that proves technical capability while showcasing projects. A functioning OS does both.

You're not reading about my React skills - you're using an application I built with React. The portfolio IS the proof.

## Structure & Navigation

The site mimics a Windows-style file system:

**Root directory contains:**

- `My Projects/` - Portfolio work with live demos and GitHub links
- `Games/` - Interactive applications (coming soon)
- `Documentation/` - Technical explanations and project deep-dives
- `Alex Moise/` - Professional background, experience, skills, contact form

**How to navigate:**

- Double-click folders to explore contents
- Double-click files to open in viewers
- Drag windows to reposition
- Use Back/Forward buttons like a browser
- Right-click desktop for system options

## What Makes It Work

**Real window management** - Not just styled divs. Actual draggable, resizable windows with z-index layering, minimize/maximize, and multi-window support.

**File Explorer** - Browser-style navigation with history. Navigate folders, view contents, open files in appropriate viewers.

**Dynamic content** - Projects load from a database. Everything else is markdown files rendered on-demand.

**Responsive interactions** - Click, drag, resize - everything responds instantly. 60fps animations, optimized re-renders, smooth performance.

## Why This Approach Works

**For visitors:**  
More engaging than scrolling through project cards. You explore at your own pace, open what interests you, ignore what doesn't.

**For me:**  
Demonstrates frontend skills (React, TypeScript, UI), backend capabilities (database), and attention to detail (UX polish, performance).

**For memory:**  
People remember the portfolio that worked like an actual computer. That's the point.

## Development Stats

**~Over 200 hours of development** across 16 phases (planning, implementation, testing, deployment).

**Current version:** Fully functional MVP with:

- Complete window management system
- File Explorer with navigation
- Document and PDF viewers
- Contact form with database integration
- Settings and customization options
- Responsive design (desktop-optimized)

**Code quality:** TypeScript strict mode, type-safe database queries, proper error handling, performance-optimized rendering.
